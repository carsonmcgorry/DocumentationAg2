**Sensors**

For this project, three types of sensors will be used, moisture, temperature, and pH sensors.

*Feasibility:*

●Must function in soil for a season ( six months approximately)

●Must cost < $15 per unit

●Must be compatible with the specified microcontroller

For the soil moisture >> it has to have at least 4 analog output
For the soil temperature >> the preferred range is -25 - +4​
5 C, which is ( ​
-13 - +1​
13 F) and it​
has to be waterproof
For the soil pH >> the typical range is 0-14, with 7 being neutral


**Merit:**

●Cost >> the cheaper the better ( all of them)

●How close they meet the feasibility range and resolution ( temp sensor)

●... ( moisture sensor)

●... ( pH sensor)



**Soil moisture Options:**

1. Gravity Moisture Sensor - corrosion Resistant (Cost ​
$7.90 per unit) ​
Source​

*General Description:*

●It measures soil moisture levels by capacitive sensing rather than resistive
sensing.

●It is made of a corrosion resistant material ( to have longer service life)

●Supports gravity 3-pin interface

●Analog output

●On-board voltage regulator

●Compatible with low-voltage MCUs

*Specifications:*

●Operating Voltage: 3.3 ~ 5.5 VDC

●Output Voltage: 0 ~ 3.0VDC

●Interface: PH2.0-3P ( what does this mean)


2. Arduino Soil Moisture Sensor Hygrometer:​ ( Cost $2.75 per unit ) ​
Source​

*Description:*

●Arduino Soil Moisture Sensor also known as a Hygrometer is used to detect the
moisture levels in soil.

●Perfect for a self watering plant project.

*Specifications:*

●VCC: 3.3V-5V.

●GND: GND.

●DO: digital output interface(0 and 1).

●AO: analog output interface.


3. SparkFun Soil Moisture Sensor: ( cost ​
